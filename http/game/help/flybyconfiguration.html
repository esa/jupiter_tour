        	In the slider associated to this icon, you can select bounds for the time of flight (in days) of the trajectory leg. 
        	The slider also shows some vertical lines. These lines are placed at the resonant periods. If you select as next target the current planet/moon, by bounding the time of flight around these lines you will most probably obtain a resonant transfer.

        	In the slider associated to this icon, you can select bounds for the periapsis of the fly-by hyperbola (units are the planet radius). The smaller this number the more energy will be stolen from the moon/planet. So in case you want to change significantly, for example, inclination or semimajor axis of your current orbit you may want to bound this number to be small.

        	In the slider associated to this icon, you can select bounds for the b-plane inclination. This plane represents the orbital plane of the planetocentric hyperbola the spacecraft will fly during a fly-by and during which it will be able to "steal" energy from the planet/moon. It is generally a good idea to leave these bounds as large as possible. In case the face targeted is not actually scored (reached) these bounds can be used to force scoring the selected face (at the expenses, probably, of propellant).
